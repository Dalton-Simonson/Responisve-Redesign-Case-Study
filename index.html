            <h3 class="karla-regular" id="main_intro_sub_text">This is the <a class="link" href="https://city-kitty.com/">site</a> for my cat's veterinary  office, which I have used fairly frequently.
               The more I used the site, the more I became aware of some of its design issues.
                So I decided to <a class="link" href="https://dalton-simonson.github.io/Responsive-Redesign/">redesign</a> the site from the ground up to provide a responsive and intuitive framework. 
                Paying particular attention to usability and accessibility in my design.

          <ul id="problem_list" class="sub_list_text karla-regular">
            <li>The signpost "buttons" are not immediately apparent as clickable</li>
            <li>The ordering of the items are seemingly  arbitrary (request appointment is sequestered off to the bottom right)</li>
            <li>Similar items are not grouped together</li>
            <li>Some of the signpost are not actually clickable but are identical to clickable elements</li>
            <li>Contrast errors throughout the site</li>
            <li>Overall slightly cluttered, unclear, and questionable color choices</li>
          </ul>


          <h2 id="sketches_label" class="montserrat-sub-section-text">Sketches</h2>

            <h3 id="sketches_text" class="sub_section_text karla-regular">The first thing I did was pick up the (Apple) pencil and got to sketching.
               I wanted to have three strong sketches that could represent each screen size.
                I kept in mind things like text hierarchy, contrast, and conventional design patterns while putting my own spin on my sketches.

            <h3 id="annotation_text" class="sub_section_text karla-regular">
              These new designs aim to tackle the issues presented above with the original site.
               The new design clearly shows what is clickable and orders those clickable elements in a sensible configuration.
                For example, making an appointment is one of the most important actions so it is right at the top in a distinguishing color and right next to hours.
                 I moved less important links/clickable elements to the bottom of the page in a style that still invites some minor attention after the main elements have been scanned.

            <h2 id="sketches_label" class="montserrat-sub-section-text">High Fidelity Mockups</h2>

            <h3 id="sketches_text" class="sub_section_text karla-regular">
              Now that I had the layouts I wanted planned out it was time to make a style guide along with some designs that would be more representative of the final product.

            <h3 id="final_text" class="sub_section_text karla-regular">
              With the style guide and hi-fi mockups I went ahead and implemented my designs <a class="link" href="https://dalton-simonson.github.io/Responsive-Redesign/">here</a>.
